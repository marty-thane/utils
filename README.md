# Utils

This repository contains a collection of shell scripts I wrote over the past
few months to simplify certain administration tasks. If you're using Linux as
your daily driver, these might come in handy.

## Table of Contents

| Script Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `block`     | a hosts-based ad blocker |
| `crypt`     | simplify managing encrypted drives |
| `wacom`     | map Wacom to screen while preserving aspect ratio |
| `wifi`      | simplify managing wireless connections |
| `xbps`      | bring APT-like syntax to XBPS package manager |

## Usage

Each script includes a description at the top, and some even print usage
information. That said, it's always better to read the code itself to ensure
you understand exactly what the script is doing (theyâ€™re not that long or
complicated anyway).
