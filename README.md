Utils
=====

This repository contains a collection of shell scripts I've written over the
past few months to simplify certain administrative tasks. If you're using Linux
as your daily driver, these might come in handy.

Contents
--------

| Name    | Description                                |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| `block` | A hosts-based ad blocker                   |
| `crypt` | Simplifies managing encrypted drives       |
| `wacom` | Maps Wacom to screen while preserving aspect ratio |
| `wifi`  | Simplifies managing wireless connections   |
| `xbps`  | Brings APT-like syntax to the XBPS package manager |

Usage
-----

Each script includes a description at the top, and some even print usage
information. That said, it's always better to read the code itself to ensure
you understand exactly what the script is doing (theyâ€™re not long or
complicated anyway).
